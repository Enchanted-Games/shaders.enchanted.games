# Useful tools

Tools that make working with vanilla shaders a little easier. All of these are optional and are not strictly required to modify vanilla shaders.

## VSCode extensions

### [glsl-analyzer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=nolanderc.glsl-analyzer)

A glsl language server for VSCode. While this doesn't support some minecraft specific things such as the `#moj_import` directive, it is still a very handy extension to have for autocompletion, formatting, and inline documentation of glsl functions.

### [Shader languages support](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=slevesque.shader)

Provides syntax highlighting for glsl.

### [Datapack Helper Plus](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=SPGoding.datapack-language-server)

Despite its name, this extension provides tools for Minecraft resource packs in general. This includes auto completion for json files and more.

## Minecraft mods

### [Stop Unloading My Resourcepacks](https://modrinth.com/mod/stop-unloading-my-resourcepacks)

Adds a debug keybind (<kbd>F3</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd>) to hot reload shaders, and stops the game from disabling all resource packs if a shader related error occurs.
